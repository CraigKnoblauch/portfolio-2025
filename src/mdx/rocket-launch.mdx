import { useRef } from 'react'
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei'
import { RocketLaunch } from 'src/components/RocketLaunch.jsx'

<div className="h-150">
<Canvas>
    <ambientLight />
    <perspectiveCamera position={[0, 0, 5]} />
    <OrbitControls />
    <RocketLaunch />
</Canvas>
</div>

That's all for now. I'll work on the other stuff in a bit
